    "The with statement is used to open the file \"example.txt\" in read mode. The file object f is created and made available within the suite of the with statement. The code block within the suite can read from or write to the file as needed. Once the block is finished executing, the file is automatically closed by the with statement.\n",

    "The advantage of using with and open() together is that it simplifies the process of handling file I/O in Python, making code more concise, readable, and less prone to errors. When opening files without using with, it's necessary to manually close the file using the close() method after reading from or writing to it. This can be error-prone if the code encounters an exception or if the programmer forgets to close the file. In contrast, using with and open() together ensures that the file is closed properly, even if the code block within the with statement raises an exception or encounters some other error."
