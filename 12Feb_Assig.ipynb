    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is disrupted, and Python creates an object known as an exception object, which contains information about the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are different from syntax errors, which occur when there is a mistake in the syntax of the program. Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed, and they prevent the program from running. In contrast, exceptions occur during program execution and can be handled by the program to prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection time: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing of the program, before the program is executed. Exceptions occur during program execution, when a specific error condition is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevention: Syntax errors prevent the program from running, whereas exceptions can be handled by the program to prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cause: Syntax errors are caused by mistakes in the syntax of the program, such as missing or incorrect keywords, operators, or punctuation. Exceptions are caused by various runtime errors, such as division by zero, invalid input, or attempting to access an object that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Syntax errors must be fixed by correcting the syntax of the program. Exceptions can be handled by the program using try and except statements to catch the exception and perform some action to handle the error condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while syntax errors are detected and prevent the program from running, exceptions are errors that occur during program execution and can be handled by the program using try and except statements to prevent the program from crashing."

    "When an exception is not handled in Python, it will propagate up the call stack until it is handled or it reaches the top of the call stack. If the exception reaches the top of the call stack without being handled, the program will terminate abruptly, and an error message will be displayed.\n",
