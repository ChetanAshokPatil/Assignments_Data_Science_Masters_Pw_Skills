    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database system that stores data in a flexible, semi-structured JSON-like format called BSON. Unlike traditional relational databases like SQL, MongoDB uses a flexible data model that allows for easier scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that store data in a non-tabular format. Unlike relational databases, which use a structured table format with rows and columns, NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family. NoSQL databases are often used for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and for scenarios where data needs to be horizontally scaled across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Scalability is a concern: MongoDB's flexible data model and horizontal scaling capabilities make it easier to scale across multiple servers without the need for complex data sharding or partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Semi-structured data: MongoDB's document-oriented data model is well-suited for handling semi-structured or unstructured data, such as data from social media, sensor data, or product catalogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Real-time data processing: MongoDB's write-intensive architecture is well-suited for real-time data processing scenarios, such as logging, content management, or online gaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Agile development: MongoDB's dynamic schema makes it easier to add or modify fields as the application evolves, providing greater flexibility for agile development teams."

    "Que 2 Answer: \n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database system that offers many features that make it well-suited for modern web and mobile applications. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Document-oriented data model: MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model that stores data in flexible, semi-structured JSON-like documents called BSON. This allows for easier scalability and performance compared to traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Indexing: MongoDB provides a rich set of indexing options that allow for efficient data access and faster queries. These include single-field, compound, geospatial, and text indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)High availability: MongoDB supports replica sets, which allow for automatic failover in the event of a server outage. This provides high availability and ensures that applications remain up and running even in the face of hardware failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Horizontal scaling: MongoDB can be horizontally scaled across multiple servers using a process called sharding. This allows for increased data throughput and improved performance as the application grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Aggregation and analytics: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex data processing and analytics. This includes support for grouping, filtering, and transformation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)Flexibility: MongoDB's dynamic schema allows for easy addition or modification of fields as the application evolves. This provides greater flexibility and agility for modern development teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "7)Multi-document transactions: Starting from version 4.0, MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, allowing developers to perform multiple operations on multiple documents in a single transaction. This ensures data consistency and helps to prevent data anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)Security: MongoDB provides several security features, including role-based access control, encryption at rest, and network encryption. This ensures that data is secure and protected from unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB provides a powerful and flexible database solution for modern web and mobile applications. Its document-oriented data model, indexing, high availability, horizontal scaling, aggregation, flexibility, multi-document transactions, and security features make it a popular choice among developers and organizations."
