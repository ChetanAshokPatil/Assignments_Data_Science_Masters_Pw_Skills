    "Que 1 Answer:\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows efficient retrieval and manipulation of that data. Databases can be used to store various types of data, such as text, numbers, images, and other multimedia formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types of databases with different characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with columns and rows, and use SQL to manipulate and query the data. SQL databases are highly structured and are ideal for applications that require complex querying and transactions, such as e-commerce, financial services, and enterprise applications. Some popular SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a variety of formats, including key-value, document, graph, and column-family models. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and flexible and are ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media data, mobile application data, and IoT data. Some popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are best suited for applications that require complex transactions and querying, while NoSQL databases are better for handling unstructured or semi-structured data that require high scalability and flexibility."

    "A primary key and a foreign key are both types of constraints in a relational database that ensure data integrity and maintain the relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It must have a unique value for each row, and it cannot be NULL. By creating a primary key constraint on one or more columns in a table, you can prevent duplicate records and ensure that each record can be uniquely identified. Primary keys are used to enforce data integrity and to establish relationships with other tables in the database. For example, in a database of employees and departments, the primary key of the employees table might be the employee ID column, which is unique for each employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, allowing data to be linked and related between the tables. By creating a foreign key constraint, you can ensure that data in the child table (the table containing the foreign key) is consistent with the data in the parent table (the table containing the primary key). For example, in a database of employees and departments, the department ID column in the employees table might be a foreign key that refers to the department ID primary key column in the departments table. This relationship ensures that each employee is associated with a valid department, and prevents orphaned records.    "
